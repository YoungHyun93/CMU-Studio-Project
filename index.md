### Project Description
The purpose of this project is to learn and implement hands-on data analysis, AI / ML, and software engineering in real-world situations. Our team will design and build Chatbot applications through this project. 
- Utilize real-world project environments where engineering can be practiced, and AI / ML technology can be applied in real-world situations. 
- Learn how to design and deploy complex, distributed intelligent systems. 
- Practice software and system engineering in a real team-oriented context. 
- Practice engineering judgment from the perspective of determining the types of tools, languages, algorithms, and strategies to be used to satisfy the requirements.
- Learn how to plan and track a team-oriented engineering project.
